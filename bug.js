```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text with gradient background.</p>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. The gradient background is defined using `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500`. However, if these color classes are not available in the version of Tailwind CSS being used, it will cause an error. The error may not be immediately obvious, leading to unexpected rendering issues. The text may appear with a default background color instead of the intended gradient.

Another common issue is the usage of utility classes that are not included in the `tailwind.config.js` file or have incorrect configuration.  This often happens if you're using plugins which introduce new utility classes without proper configuration, or if you're experimenting with new classes in your `tailwind.config.js` but have forgotten to rebuild the CSS.
