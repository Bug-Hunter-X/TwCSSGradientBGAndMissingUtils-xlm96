# Tailwind CSS Bug Report: Gradient Background and Missing Utility Classes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to gradient backgrounds and missing utility classes.  The bug arises when using color classes that are either not available in the current Tailwind CSS version or aren't properly configured in `tailwind.config.js`. This often results in unexpected rendering behavior where the gradient is not applied correctly or utility classes don't function as expected.

## Bug Description
The primary bug involves incorrect rendering of a gradient background due to missing color classes.  In addition, using utility classes that are not defined (or misconfigured) within `tailwind.config.js` will cause unexpected behavior.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` (or equivalent for your package manager).
3. Open `bug.js` to view the buggy code.
4. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the fixed code.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring all used utility classes are correctly defined within your `tailwind.config.js` file and that your Tailwind CSS version supports the used classes. You may need to update your Tailwind CSS installation or adjust your configuration.
